# ModAPL
Parallel implementation of an iterative projection-type algorithm for solving non-stationary systems of linear inequalities on computing clusters.

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of the novel ModAPL algorithm for solving large-scale non-stationary systems of linear inequalities on computing clusters. The solution is built in C++ using the BSF-skeleton. The source codes of the BSF-skeleton with an user manual are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.

A description of the ModAPL algorithm is available in the paper [1].
